What values does DreamHost's API use?
Required

key
An API Key that you need to generate via the web panel.

In order  for a  sub-account to create  an API Key,  it must  be granted
'Billing' Account Privileges.

Please note that  if a sub-account creates  an API Key, it  will only be
visible to the sub-account on the API Key page in the panel. The primary
account owner  will not  be able  to view the  sub-account's API  Key in
their panel.

cmd 

The  command you'd like  to run. When you  create your key  you pick
what  command(s)   it  may  access.   

unique_id
  
You may  pass a  new unique_id  (max length: 64  chars) when  you submit
a request, to  make sure you don't accidentally submit  the same command
twice.  Note  that  only  successful queries  \"use  up\"  a  unique_id.
DreamHost  recommends  using  UUIDs  for this  purpose  if  you'd  like.
The unique_id  you use  only applies  to your specific  API key,  so you
never need to  worry about any other users already  \"using\" a specific
unique_id. 

Optional

format

The format you want to receive output in. Valid formats are:

tab (default)
xml
json
perl
php
yaml
html

account

The account  number to  perform operations under.  Defaults to  your own
account, or the first account you have access to otherwise.


Rate limit

In order to ensure that DreamHost systems remains stable and responsive,
the rate at which certain API commands  or groups of API commands can be
run  by the  same user  has been  limited. These  limits are  relatively
generous and very  few users ever run into them.  Limits are usually set
per hour or  per day, although some commands may  have limits in shorter
periods  of  time such  as  10  minutes. When  API  calls  fail for  any
reason (for example if you tried to create a user that already existed),
it does  not count against your  limits (note that this  also means that
failing  because you  exceeded  the  rate limit  also  does not  count).
When you do run into a limit, the error returned is:

error

slow_down_bucko (detailed info about type of limit reached after a tab)

If you run into this error, you  should consider ways in which you could
reduce the frequency that you are calling the API. Most likely you would
only run  into these limits  if you have  a script or  automated program
that loops to repeatedly make API calls. So you can simply slow down the
rate at which your script runs, or  make sure that it keeps track of how
many commands it has issued in the last hour/day.

Test Account

If you wish to test the DreamHost API without having your own account, you
may use the following API Key:

6SHU5P2HLDAYECUM

This account only has access to \"list\" functions however (and only
user-list_users_no_pw, not user-list_users) , as well as
dreamhost_ps-set_size, dreamhost_ps-set_settings, and dreamhost_ps-reboot to
ps7093.

An example

https://api.dreamhost.com/?key=6SHU5P2HLDAYECUM&cmd=user-list_users_no_pw&unique_id=4082432&format=perl

If you are writing a simple bash script to interface with DreamHost's API,
this may help as a start:

#!/bin/sh
####
#### USE THIS SCRIPT AT YOUR OWN RISK.
####

PS=$1

KEY=YOUR-KEY-HERE
UUID=`uuidgen`
CMD=user-list_users_no_pw

if [ $# -lt 1 ]; then
echo usage: `basename $0` [hostname]
exit 1
fi

if [ $PS = "" ]; then
PS=`hostname | cut -f1 -d.`
fi

# ARGS='other_http_get_arguments_for_the_DreamHost_cmd_that_you_are_using=4&foo=123'
