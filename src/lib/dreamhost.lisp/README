Dreamhost ( https://dreamhost.com/ ) hosting service has two main API's.

One,  for DreamCompute,  is a  subset of  OpenStack and  can be  treated
as such.

This  is for  the other  one;  for the  non-DreamCompute shared  hosting
customers. This  is a set  of access functions  for things like  the DNS
record editing that can be reached over the legacy API.

This is really not usable yet (11/2018).
