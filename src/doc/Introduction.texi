@section What is Tootsville?

Tootsville was  the flagship product  which helped develop  the original
Romance game system into such  a powerful suite. Its commercial sponsor,

The resurrected game  (with the permission of several  of Res's managing
members) is now the flagship for the ongoing development of Romance Ⅱ.
