confusing. (In Romance 1.x, the inventory was considered to have a sequence
of integer inventory slots, into which items were inserted.)
@item baseColor, color
If the item's avatar has a layer named \"Base\", it should be recolored to this
color.
@item altColor
If the item's avatar has a layer named \"Alt\", it should be recolored to this
color.
@item template
The description of the item's template, as per `ITEM-TEMPLATE-INFO'.
@item energy, health
The amount of energy that this item has, if any. 
@item avatarScale
The scaling of the avatar in each of @code{x}, @code{y}, and @code{z} 
dimentions.
@item rarity

@item position and x,y,z
The position of the avatar within the 200m cube

@code{longitude}, @code{altitude}, and @code{world}. 
See `ITEM-LATITUDE', `ITEM-LONGITUDE', `ITEM-ALTITUDE', `ITEM-WORLD'
@item itemType, title
The name of the item's template. See `ITEM-TEMPLATE-NAME'
@item itemID
The unique ID of the item's template.
See `ITEM-TEMPLATE-ID', `ITEM-TEMPLATE'
@item inRoom
Deprecated. Always returns ``@code{@@Tootsville}'' now.
@item ownerID
The UUID of the Toot who owns this item, if any. If there is no owner, 
returns the string ``@code{-1}''.
See `ITEM-OWNER'
@item isActive
If this item is equipped by its owner, then this value is @code{true}.
See `ITEM-IS-EQUIPPED-P'
