** Tootsville â…¤ Game

This package contains the working copy of the Tootsville V game, as it is
being built / merged-into

** External Components

The game system is essentially made up of 8 pillars, or main components.
Three of these are completely external:

*** The Wiki-wiki

The Wiki-wiki is a Mediawiki installation and is used as an external source
of documentation both within the game, and externally. The contents of the
Wiki-wiki are not maintained in this repository.

*** Jumbo

The static game content, and larger or shared web content, are hosted on
Jumbo, and are not maintained in this repo, either.

*** Tootsbook

Tootsbook is a Wordpress installation, and is likewise completely external.

** Internal Components

Within this repository are the main, "internal" components.

*** Play

The Play application is the "in-game" Javascript application that presents
the 3D world and Heads-Up Display (HUD) overlays.

The front-end components are, at least partially, in Javascript.

**** Login

The Login application manages user sign-up, character selection, and the
like from the front-end. It interacts mostly with the Users service.

**** Toot Management

Pick a character

**** Babylon.js integration

**** Input handling

- keyboard/mouse/GUI
- Firefox gamepad support?
- Bluetooth gamepads?

**** Sound synth

**** Peer-to-peer Gossip Network

**** Asset fetch/share

**** Worker thread

*** Servers

**** Load Balancer
**** Users

 The Users application is a REST server providing human and Toot user
 information,   and   is  used   to   log   in,  and   identify   player
 (Toot) inventory.

***** Log in

Autovivifies a new user profile when a Google auth token is received.

If the  email address is  on file, there can  be an account  that exists
without a known auth token. This is how we're implementing two features:

****** Sending welcome gifts to new users before they first sign up

****** Pre-registering Toot names for certain specific users

***** Create new Toot

**** Gossip

 The Gossip application is a directory service used to initiate the Gossipnet
 connections between players (by Play).

**** World

 The World application quiesces and burgeons  areas of the game world and
 provides conflict resolution of user action lists.

*** Operations

 Deployment is spelled out in  the Makefile.  In general, the front-end
 Javascript applications are compiled down, compressed, and sent off to
 their respective ("dumb," static) servers.

 The  back-end application  systems each  run  a respective  copy of  the
 monolithic Tootsville  executable. This is a  single executable compiled
 from   the  same   Common  Lisp   sources  on   each  host   (to  ensure
 CPU-OS-Compiler-Library match-ups, allow  compile-time optimizations for
 the host configuration, and avoid surprises).
